# GT-Signup
#### To run, change your directory to GT-Signup-Public-master, and input your username, password, and phone number into 'userinfo.keys'. Then, go to Twilio.com and purchase a phone number for $1. Input your SID and token into signup.py as instructed, then run the python file by typing 


```
python signup.py
```
#### This program works by finding certain HTML elements by their XPath value, which can be done using simple loops and conditionals. Once these elements are found, the selenium library can input strings into text boxes, click on buttons, and many more, making HTTP POST useless, although I still used HTTP GET. The selenium library makes it very easy to navigate the web, and along with the Twilio API, can be a great pair for making fun Python Scripts like this one. Thanks to this, I got the Linear Algebra professor I wanted! (Shoutout to Dr. Mayer)
